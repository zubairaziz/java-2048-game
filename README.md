 3. Score.java is used to store player score, high score, and 2048 check
 4. Utility.java is used to format all the printing
 5. Banner.java just prints out certain instructions and information
 6. Instructions:
   * All very straightforward
   * Run the game and follow the instructions
   * Use WASD keys and Enter key to make a move
   * Game ends when the 2048 tile is reached
